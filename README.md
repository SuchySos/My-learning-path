## Overview

All projects are in prototype phase and I feel no reason to finish what I started because I don't want to waste time on shaping the projects that were intended to teach me the basics and other concepts.

## Autoclicker

The oldest one and I am most proud of this project. I have learned a lot from it from object-oriented programming to creating a standalone application and I saw why python is not the best for this type of tasks. I am aware that the threads are not very well done.

## Game in Godot

Game written entirely in GDScript, only shaders were in C#. The models were made in Blender. I managed to export it to Android in .apk format that is in APK file (I removed the Android export template so that it doesn't unnecessarily clog Github).

Godot recently released a new version, so work on the project was based mainly on documentation that is not complete and on trial and error.

The game prototype is not the worst, but the game concept is a bit disappointing, and what is happening on the screen is not legible, but I had a lot of fun making this game.

## Scraper + AI

Unfinished project. it was intended to co-work with S-Bot.
 
I wanted to set up my own AI (Rebuilt agent and environment based on a bot that balanced a stick on a cart.) it was supposed to make decisions based on scraped data from various sites in real time.

The entire project must be built from scratch to work properly. There was no proper plan before writing the application, and there was no knowledge that I acquired while writing the code.

Of course, everything could be done faster by using the appropriate API.
